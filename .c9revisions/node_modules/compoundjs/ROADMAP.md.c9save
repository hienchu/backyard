And it should be just collection of\nfilenames, to work with express 3.x view engine.\n\nRevise block-dependent helpers such as formFor and fieldsFor, disable when\ntemplating engine is not jade/ejs.\n\n## Upcoming development\n\n### Structure API\n\nExpose views/controllers/helpers/models as replaceable parts of `railway.structure` hash.\n\n### Controllers without eval\n\nIt should be possible to use pure controllers with no eval-magic. With ability\nto inherit controllers and use any controller package, not only kontroller.\n\n### CASE-sensitivity in model/crud generators\n\nhttps://github.com/1602/express-on-railway/issues/218\n\n\n"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":798}]],"length":798}
